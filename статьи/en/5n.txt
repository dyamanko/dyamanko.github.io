     COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF TWO MOST POPULAR JAVASCRIPT
       FRAMEWORKS FOR MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT

            This article presents a comparative analysis of two of the most popular Java Script frameworks for develop-
      ment of a mobile application such as Ionic 2 and React Native. At the very beginning, necessity of having mobile
      applications in modern times was considered. After that, the article explained a way mobile applications are distrib-
      uted among their consumers. Then the author continues with a general explanation of the main functions of each of
      the frameworks. Furthermore, each framework’s features will be discussed. Moreover, the way of writing the code
      using each of the tools will be also explained. Then we will focus on the debugging process for both Ionic 2 and
      React Native; look at the way how to work with styles; we will consider how the precise tool influences the size of
      the final application. Next, frameworks will be compared depending on their popularity. Finally, the conclusion will
      be provided in the form of a list of the main advantages and disadvantages of compared tools.
